    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on using **neural networks** with many layers (hence \"deep\"). These networks are designed to automatically learn and extract meaningful patterns from large datasets. Deep learning excels in tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and time series forecasting, where traditional models may struggle to capture complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>**What is MLP?**</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** is a type of **feedforward neural network** consisting of multiple layers of neurons:\n",
    "- An input layer,\n",
    "- One or more hidden layers,\n",
    "- An output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron is connected to every neuron in the next layer, and the network learns by adjusting the weights of these connections to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs. MLPs are good for tasks where patterns can be learned directly from the input data, but they struggle with sequential data like time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>**What is RNN?**</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** is a type of neural network designed to handle **sequential data**, such as time series or text. Unlike MLPs, RNNs have connections that loop back on themselves, allowing them to \"remember\" information from previous steps in the sequence. This makes RNNs well-suited for tasks where context or memory is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, RNNs often face issues like **vanishing gradients**, which can make learning long-term dependencies difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>**What is LSTM?**</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)** is a type of RNN that addresses the limitations of traditional RNNs, particularly the issue of vanishing gradients. LSTMs introduce special units called **gates** (input, forget, and output gates) that allow the network to selectively retain or discard information over long sequences. This enables LSTMs to learn both **short-term** and **long-term** dependencies more effectively, making them ideal for time series forecasting where patterns span over different timescales.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to this [excellent blog](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) to understand more about LSTMs and RNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we will focus on building forecasting models using **LSTM networks**. While we will primarily work with LSTMs, replacing them with **RNNs** or **MLPs** is relatively straightforward and will be left as an exercise for you to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: \n",
    "There are several Python libraries available that offer pre-built implementations for time series forecasting. However, as of September 2024, many of these libraries are still under active development. While they can be useful due to their pre-specified knowledge and tools, itâ€™s valuable to learn how to implement your own models from scratch. This will give you a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics. That being said, here are some libraries you might want to be aware of:\n",

    "\n",

While many time series models use a single feature per time step, it is possible to include multiple features, such as lagged values or categorical features like day of the week, making the dimension of each time step larger than one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, time series data may have sequences of varying lengths. In cases where some sequences are shorter than others, **padding** is applied. Padding involves a separate tensor that indicates where the valid data is, using 1s for valid data points and 0s for the padded values."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this optional section, we will look at the design of an expanding window dataloader. \n",
    "We want to be able to handle sequences of varying lengths.\n",
    "The difficulty arises because `torch.nn.utils.DataLoader` batches all the samples in a single tensor and a tensor can't have variable length elements.\n",
    "As a result, we need to pad our sequences so that all of them are of the same length. \n",
    "\n",
    "`collate_fn` argument passed to `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, helps in preprocessing individual samples returned from `torch.utils.data.Dataset` so that they are of the same length.\n",
    "PyTorch provides efficient implmenetation of recurrent networks such as RNNs, LSTMs while handling sequences of unequal lengths.\n",
    "This implmementation requires `PackedSequence` object, which is a batch of unequal sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "`PackedSequence` has two attributes: \n",
    "  - **Data**: A flattened list of all the non-padded elements from the input sequences, stacked together.\n",
    "  - **Batch sizes**: A tensor that specifies how many valid (non-padded) sequences are present at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a value of 12 at index 1 of `batch_sizes` mean that there are 12 sequences that are active at that time step. \n",
    "Recurrent networks in PyTorch are designed to efficiently process the inputs by keeping track of the number of seqeunces alive at any time step, thereby not wasting compute resources on paddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - By using the **`batch_sizes`** tensor, PyTorch knows exactly how many sequences are \"alive\" (non-padded) at each time step.\n",
    " - Instead of iterating over all time steps for all sequences (which would involve unnecessary computations on padded values), PyTorch processes only the non-padded entries.\n",
    " \n",
    " In essence, PyTorch only processes the valid data points in the `PackedSequence`, while completely ignoring any padded elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `batch_sizes` attribute of this object holds the number of sequences alive at a particular index. \n",
    "Thus, a value of 12 at index 1 of `batch_sizes` mean that there are 12 sequences that are active at that time step. \n",
    "Recurrent networks in PyTorch are designed to efficiently process the inputs by keeping track of the number of seqeunces alive at any time step, thereby not wasting compute resources on paddings. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We covered how to build deep learning models for time series forecasting. We learned how to implement **dataloaders** in PyTorch to efficiently pack and prepare samples for time series forecasting. Additionally, we explored how to use **PyTorch** and the **Lightning framework** to build and train LSTM models, simplifying the model training process and improving efficiency. Finally, we learned how to use **Optuna** for hyperparameter optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increase `SEQUENCE_LENGTH` and observe whether this has any impact on model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adapt the SlidingFixedWindow method to handle **variable-length sequences** in the input data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Add new features to the inputs, such as day of the week, lag features, or other time-related variables.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Experiment with different hidden dimensions for the LSTM to see how the size of the hidden layer affects the model's accuracy.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Replace the LSTM module with a simple **feed-forward network (MLP)** and compare the performance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Replace the LSTM module with a standard **RNN** or a **stacked LSTM** architecture to evaluate whether more complex structures improve the results.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Apply a normalization procedure (e.g., **min-max scaling**) to the data, ensuring that only the training data is used for fitting the scaler. Perform the modeling process on the normalized data and, after generating the final model's predictions, invert the normalization to return the output to its original scale. See `sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler` ([documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additionally, perform the modeling on the **raw data**, without applying any transformation (such as converting it into log daily returns), to compare results directly with the untransformed dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- To understand the limitations of LSTM in time series modeling, proceed to Notebook 5.1, where we will explore and implement the LSTNet architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To learn about more advanced deep learning based approaches, proceed to module 6 (Transformer based models) or module 7 (LLM-based models).\n",
