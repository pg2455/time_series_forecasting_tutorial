    "Time series data is ubiquitous across various real-world scenarios, such as traffic flow, weather patterns, and economic indicators. \n",
    "Multiple methods have been developed, addressing tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forecasting:** Predict future events based on historical time series data.\n",
    "- **Anomaly Detection:** Spot unusual patterns that deviate from expected behavior.\n",
    "- **Clustering:** Categorize similar time series.\n",
    "- **Classification:** Assign time series data to predefined classes.\n",
    "- **Segmentation:** Break down a time series into meaningful segments.\n",
    "- **Change Point Detection:** Determine points at which the statistical properties of the series shift significantly.\n",
    "- **Causality Analysis:** Use techniques like Granger causality to discover relationships between different time series.\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Apply methods such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to reduce the complexity of time series data.\n",

We will use Python libraries to build an understanding of time series forecasting problems, the challenges involved, and various forecasting techniques through hands-on python notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to Expect (and Not Expect) at the End?**\n",
    "This tutorial is designed to introduce you to both the research literature and the open-source community surrounding time series forecasting techniques. You'll gain familiarity with a wide range of approaches, from classical methods to advanced LLM-based models. However, if you have a specific dataset, additional exploration may be required. Completing this tutorial will not guarantee a solution for your unique time series problem, but you will develop enough intuition and understanding to navigate online resources effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is not covered?**\n",
    "Each module is focused on exposing you to a specific class of techniques, such as transformer-based architectures or LLM-based approaches. However, it is not feasible to exhaustively cover all methods within these categories. The goal is not exhaustive coverage but rather to provide you with the foundational understanding needed to explore the space on your own.\n",

    "The main criterion for choosing the libraries in this tutorial is their suitability for time series forecasting and the availability of larger community support. However, this is not always possible. As of September 2024, `GluonTS`, `neuralforecast`, and `Chronos` are still undergoing significant development, and their interfaces might change or stop being supported by the developers altogether. Therefore, it is important to ensure that particular versions of these libraries are installed.\n",
